	<hr class="hr"></hr>
	<p class="subtitle2">I am a Management and Business Analytics master student fully bilingual in Spanish and English, with intermediate knowledge of French. I have experience in working cross-functionally and cross-culturally, which gives me a better understanding of how to adapt to different environments. I believe that people who have worked with me or met me professionally will describe me as a hard-working individual, patient and always willing to help others. Always competitive I played football where, as a captain, I leaded my team to achieve great results.</p>
