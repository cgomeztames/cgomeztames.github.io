	<p class="subtitle2">I am a Management and Business Analytics master student with knowledge of the work done in different departments of a company thanks to what I studied in my Bachelor’s degree, which allows me to have a better understanding of the bigger picture of a company. I am able to speak fluently two languages, Spanish and English, and understand French. I would describe myself as someone with a high adaptation capacity after having studied in three different countries; Spain, UK and Malta. On the other hand, I believe that people who I worked with will describe me as a hard-working individual, patient and always trying to help if someone in the group needs so.<p class="secondary-titles">Key Skills</p>
